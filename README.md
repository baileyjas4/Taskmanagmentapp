Challenges faced during the project.
How you approached solving those challenges.
What you would improve if given more time.
Honestly , everything wasn’t too difficult in style or html my issue was just trying to understand java and making the codes and functions to get everything to work together also trying to add the drop box and making sure my code worked as far as inputting text and adding color text just overall making my project work and function i did a lot of second guessing 

I approached my challenges by looking back at projects I've done i went on websites that helped me structure my codes and getting exactly what i wanted i also leaned on classmates for a little more help and better understanding of it 

I would improve by really trying to fully understand what i am doing and grasp the concept i feel like if i didnt miss part of the class the other day i would've maybe gotten concept and been less confused
